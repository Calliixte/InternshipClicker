Made to get familiar with VueJS manipulation, uses the script tag with a link instead of a proper VueJS installation.

 - About : 
    - Clicker game based on the impossibility of getting any junior level position in tech jobs (may be the case in other fields but i do not have experience with anything other than tech)
    - Very unbalanced

 - Additional Notes :

     - (2025-02-05) The description for the passive upgrades does not match the effect given

     - Made to get familiar with VueJS manipulation, uses the script tag with a link instead of a proper VueJS installation.

     - The upgrades json file should be in /externalFiles but github pages was not able to load data from it if the path was like that so I was forced to move at root.
